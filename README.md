# TimeShare
This repo contains my code for TimeShare. An iMessage App which allows one person to create a list of dates that an event could take place on, and send that list to other people in the chat. They will be able to see how many votes have been cast for each date, then add their own votes. In a group chat, this should mean that a group can pick the best date from various options.
